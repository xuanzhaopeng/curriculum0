The museum decides to hold the paintings in a digital exhibit where each viewer is asked to guess the number of paintings they see in the exhibit. Each viewer, at random, guesses a random number from $1$ to $300$. The paintings are displayed in a way that the number of paintings visible to a viewer depends on the total number of paintings in the exhibit and their random guess. What is the probability that the number of paintings visible to a viewer, based on their random guess and the exhibit's arrangement, is a multiple of $5$?",
