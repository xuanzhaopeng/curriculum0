    "question": "A rectangular box has a volume $ V = x \\times y \\times z $, where $ x, y, z $ are the dimensions of the box. A student initially thought it's a cube, so he reason that all sides are the same. However, upon realizing that $ x \\neq y \\neq z $, he starts investigating different possible numbers for $ x, y, z $ to see if this condition holds true. But after realizing that a cube is still a cube, he moves to considering a rectangular prism where $ x, y, z $ are not necessarily the same. What is the smallest positive integer value of $ x, y, z $ such that the volume equation holds true for some integer values and satisfies the real-world condition (i.e., no side is zero)?",
