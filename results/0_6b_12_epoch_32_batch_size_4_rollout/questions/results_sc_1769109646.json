    "question": "Imagine a perfect ordinary speeded runner who can run at a constant speed of 3m/s. A thief starts at the same position and runs at a constant speed of 2m/s. At the start of the race, the runner has 5 times more strength than the thief. The thief decides to always run \u201cback and forth\u201d along the track, starting from his initial position. The thief's back-and-forth motion is constant and easy to run, and the runner continues to stay on the course and run forward. At point A which is 130m ahead of the thief\u2019s start location, the thief walks back to his starting point and recalculates the distance he has to run to end the race. What is the distance between the thief\u2019s final position and the runner\u2019s final position at the end of the race?",
