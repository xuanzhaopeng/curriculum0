    "question": "A sequence of positive integers starts with 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous term and the number of distinct prime factors of the previous term. For example, the second term is $1 + 1 = 2$, since 1 has no prime factors but the convention is that 1 has 0, so actually 1 + 0 = 1 \u2014 wait, correction: the rule is that each term is the previous term plus the number of distinct prime factors of the previous term. So starting from 1, the number of distinct prime factors of 1 is 0, so the next term is $1 + 0 = 1$, and the sequence becomes constant at 1. But that can't be the intended behavior. So let's redefine carefully: perhaps the sequence begins with $a_1 = 1$, and for $n \\geq 2$, $a_n = a_{n-1} + \\omega(a_{n-1})$, where $\\omega(k)$ is the number of distinct prime factors of $k$. What is the first term that is divisible by 7 in this sequence?",
