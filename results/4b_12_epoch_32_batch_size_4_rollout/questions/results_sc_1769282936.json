    "question": "In a certain kingdom, every citizen either always tells the truth or always lies. There are two bridges, A and B, each guarded by a guard who may be a truth-teller or a liar. When asked if their guard is a truth-teller, Bridge A's guard replies \"Yes,\" and Bridge B's guard replies \"No.\" If you are allowed to ask each guard only one more question, how can you determine which bridge is safe to cross, knowing that the bridge is safe to cross if and only if both guards are truth-tellers?",

      "Ask each guard: \"If I were to ask the other guard if this bridge is safe to cross, what would he say?\" If the guard answers \"Yes,\" then the bridge is not safe. If the guard answers \"No,\" then the bridge is safe.",

      "Ask either guard, \"Is the other guard a truth-teller?\". If the answer is \"Yes\", then the bridge is safe. If the answer is \"No\", then the bridge is not safe.",
      "Ask the guard at Bridge A: \"Is it true that you are a liar or the other guard is a truth-teller?\". If the answer is \"Yes\", Bridge A is safe. Otherwise, Bridge B is safe."
