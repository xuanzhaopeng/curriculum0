    "question": "In the land of Zephyria, there exists a peculiar species of birds known as the Flutters, each with a unique number of feathers that is a positive integer. The number of feathers on a Flutters is always a divisor of another Flutters' number of feathers. Today, a group of Flutters decided to stage a feather counting festival where they will pair up for symbolic exchanges of feathers. Each Flutters sends one feather to another. After the exchanges, every Flutters ends up with as many feathers as there were Flutters at the beginning. If there are 7 Flutters participating and it is known that no Flutters received or gave more than 2 feathers in total, how many feathers were on the Flutters who ended up giving feathers?",
