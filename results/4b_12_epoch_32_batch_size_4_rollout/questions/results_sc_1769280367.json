    "question": "In a social network application, there is a feature that allows users to send gifts to other users. The application uses a system where each gift sends a certain amount of energy to the recipient. However, if the recipient's energy reaches a maximum capacity, any additional energy from gifts is lost and not transferred. Each user starts with 100 energy points. User A sends a gift to User B, which transfers 50 energy points to User B. If User B's energy points reach the maximum capacity of 150, any additional energy from future gifts to User B will not be transferred. If User B sends a gift to User C, transferring 40 energy points, and then User C sends a gift back to User B, transferring 30 energy points, what will be the final energy points for User B? Provide your answer as a numerical value.",
