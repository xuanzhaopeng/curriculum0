The civilizations must reach a state where their territories interconnect, forming a continuous metropolis across all accessible planets in their universe.\n\nGiven these constraints, calculate at which stage, in terms of epochs or time intervals since the event, these civilizations, despite their restrictions, will first be able to logically connect their territories, ensuring all planets are used as part of this metropolis. Assume no new countries can be formed during this endeavor, and each civilization grows at the following rates per epoch:\n\n-Civilization X: annexes two additional hexagons.\n-Civilization Y: annexes two more units of the rectangular land.\n-Civilization Z: territories with circular geometric forces expand less than the other two without significantly altering their ratio in territory size.\n\nPay close attention to these parameters and the mathematical relationships between formation rates and existing territory sizes.",
