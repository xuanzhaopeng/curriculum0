They must enroll in afit.com, a fitness website where a restricted diet streaming service offers videos reliant on doing robotic repetitions as opposed to human exertion. The $i$^{th} video is $a_i$ meters long, can only be rented for an initial period of $b_i$ weeks after $0$, and there is a rental cost of $c_i$ dollars after the $b_i$ weeks, but before another video order.\n\nThe person intends to do exactly one video per training session, meaning they can't rent the same video twice for a training session. After $b_i$ weeks, a video's availability is disabled and it no longer requires rentable access. Refunds are only possible if a number is unable to be rented, erasing the cost for that dollar. Over time as a person's retirement funds are trimmed for food and shelter, resources for gym membership ought to be utilized judiciously independently of the fitbund video usage potential. If not, auxiliary sums wouldn't be derived.\n\nWhat is the highest debt obliviousness, described as some amount of pants weekly to make adjustments planned through boring aquatic machines, but on secondary and offering desires quite vaguely, having revealed approximate limits to their agility in low diversions?
